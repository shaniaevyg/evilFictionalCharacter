    		<h1>About Terra : The Teen Titans Harlot</h1>
    		<p>    As a child, Terra and her brother Geo-Force were Markovia royalty. She was a stubborn child, confused with who she was and reluctant to follow orders when told how to act. As children, the siblings were forced to undergo experiments whose sole purpose was to make them heroes, just so that they could protect their family. The experiments gave her the powers, but not the means nor understanding of how to control them. Her fear of harming others drove her to run away; frequently moving around most likely because of her unfortunate tendency to accidentally do more harm than good whenever she would try to help others.</p>
    		<p>    Her relationship with the Teen Titans is quite complicated. Although she used to be a member, Slade coerced her into joining him; tempting her with his promises to help her control her powers in exchange for unyielding loyalty.</p>
    		<p>    Importantly, one of the most atrocious acts she's ever committed was playing with Beast Boy, a member of the Teen Titans. He saw her as a romantic interest, a potential girlfriend, and she crushed him. She willingly attempted to be with him, his friend, knowing both his feelings and that her position as his enemy, which she tried to hide, would heavily complicate things.</p>
